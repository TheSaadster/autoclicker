# Auto Clicker
#### Project Showcase: https://youtu.be/dOaPg-ak_g0
This Python script provides a basic auto-clicking functionality using the `pynput` library.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library (`pip install pynput`)

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the prerequisites installed.
3. Run the script `main.py`.

## How it Works

The script listens for the press of the "p" key to toggle auto-clicking functionality. Once toggled on, the script continuously simulates left mouse button clicks at a specified interval until toggled off.

## Configuration

You can adjust the click frequency by changing the `time.sleep()` interval in the `clicker()` function.
